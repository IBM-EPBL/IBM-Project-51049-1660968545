                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have them in their house backyard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher rate of mortality without causing injury to children. Children under six of their age are found to be suffering the highest drowning mortality rates worldwide. Such kinds of deaths account for the third cause of unplanned death globally, with about 1.2  million cases yearly.</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.By studying body movement patterns and connecting cameras to artificial intelligence (AI) systems we can devise an underwater pool safety system that reduces the risk of drowning.  Usually, such systems can be developed by installing more than 16 cameras underwater and ceiling and analyzing the video feeds to detect any anomalies. but  AS a POC we make use of one camera that streams the video underwater and analyses the position of swimmers to assess the probability of drowning, if it is higher then an alert will be generated to attract lifeguards' attention</p>

            <p>VirtualEye works like an “extra lifeguard” under the water of your pool.Our object recognition software tracks the movements of all swimmers in a pool.  And in the event of a serious drowning incident, VirtualEye will provide an alarm to pool lifeguards.  This will help lifeguards improve their reaction-time, as they initiate a rescue.</p>
